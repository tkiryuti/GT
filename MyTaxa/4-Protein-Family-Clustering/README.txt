Protein Family Clustering

All the representative protein sequences from species pangenomes were combined and clustered with Linclust using greedy clustering by sequence length with criteria of above 40 % sequence identity and above 70 % aligned residues on target sequence (Steinegger et al. 2018).

The total number of protein sequences clustered into protein families (at 40 % sequence identity) were 63,751,597 into 13,139,838 representatives of clusters ranging from 1 to 14604 members (including the representative, or longest sequence).
