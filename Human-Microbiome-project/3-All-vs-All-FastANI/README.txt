All vs. all FastANI

FastANI was run between all possible pairs in the MAG collection by running 2000 vs. 2000 MAGs in 1128 jobs (Jain et al. 2018). The MAG pairs were filtered to keep alignment fraction between genomes >= 20 % and with the MiGA quality value both available and >= 50 % for both MAGs in the pair. The quality values from MiGA based on essential genes were different from the CheckM quality values provided by Almeida et al. (still with the same equation: quality = completeness â€“ 5 x contamination).
