Fisher's Exact Tests on geographical origin pairs

The Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data was conducted in RStudio on each pair of continents and countries from each of the three FastANI ranges of 75-85 % (divergent), 85-95 % (intermediate), and 95-100 % (closely related) with the null hypothesis that the continent or country pair is independent of the FastANI range. Enrichment values were calculated as the natural log of observed over expected values, where observed value is the frequency that a location pair was observed in a FastANI range. The expected value was calculated from each location pair vs. ANI range contingency table: (row total)*(column total)/(grand total), where the row total represents the total pairs of location1 vs. location2 across all ranges and the column total the number of pairs in one of the three ANI ranges across all location pairs.
