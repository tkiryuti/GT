Pangenome Clustering

For each species with less than 2,000 genomes from the NCBI assembly database, all proteins from all genomes were clustered into “pangenomes” using Linclust with greedy clustering by sequence length if matching criteria for above 90 % sequence identity, above 70 % aligned residues on target sequence,  (Steinegger et al. 2018). For the rest of the “highly sampled” species (over 2,000 genomes), the representative proteins from 99 % dereplication were run through this pangenome clustering.
