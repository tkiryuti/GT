## MyTaxa project introduction

MyTaxa Scan is a tool based on the MyTaxa taxonomic classifier useful for finding questionable regions in Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) that might be caused by contamination, horizontal gene transfer, or miss-assembly (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/W1/W282/5037719">Rodriguez-R et al. 2018</a>). The clustered gene database of MyTaxa was previously obtained from the 2013 GenBank release (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4005636/">Luo et al. 2014</a>). Since then, there have been many more genomes uploaded to NCBI, requiring a database update and larger-scale clustering.
