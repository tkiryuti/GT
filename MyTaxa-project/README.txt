Introduction

MyTaxa Scan is a tool based on the MyTaxa taxonomic classifier useful for finding questionable regions that might be caused by contamination, horizontal gene transfer, or miss-assembly in Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) (Rodriguez-R et al. 2018). The clustered gene database of MyTaxa was previously obtained from the 2013 GenBank release (Luo et al. 2014). Since then, there have been many more genomes uploaded to NCBI, requiring a database update and larger-scale clustering.
